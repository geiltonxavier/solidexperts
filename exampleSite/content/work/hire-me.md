I have over 10 years of experience in software development.

Over those years, I have worked and currently work mainly with .NET and C#. 
I also worked for some time with Ruby/Rails. 

No restrictions on learning new technology.

Over the years, I've accumulated experience as a .NET software engineer.

I am a developer focused on best practices, concerned with producing clean code, refactoring, and always writing automated tests (before and/or after).

Specialties: web development, object-oriented software construction, concurrent software development, software architecture, domain driven design, agile methods, performance analysis and optimization, .NET, Ruby, JS, TypeScript
