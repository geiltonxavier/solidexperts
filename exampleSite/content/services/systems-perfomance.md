A bottleneck is a point of congestion in a production system (such as an assembly line or a computer network) that stops or severely slows the system.

## Cost Reduction in Production

The inefficiencies brought about by the bottleneck often create delays and higher production costs.

The term “bottleneck” refers to the typical shape of a bottle and the fact that the bottle’s neck is the narrowest point, which is the most likely place for congestion to occur, slowing down the flow of liquid from the bottle.
